# ITAI-2376-Portfolio

This portfolio contains the coursework I did for my ITAI 2376 - Deep Learning Artificial Intellgence Class.
In this course I learned about the concepts of Deep Learning, Neural Networks, NLP, Transformers, Encoders, Machine Learning, and more. I also learned about the foundations of AI Agents, and got hands on experience with projects relating to the creation of various Machine Learning Models. These projects were usually complete in groups, and were focused on labs where we had to fill in parts of code, create architectures and concepts of a Neural Network, and building our own working agents.

Overview of Each Module's Work

Module 2:
(AO2) Analysis of two Machine/Deep Learning Tools (Hugging Face Transformers VS OpenAI ChatGPT), comparing their development, features, and applications.
(L02) Interacted with a pre-built deep learning model, gaining an insight on how the model work and making a report based on the understanding.

Module 3:
(A03) Tasked with understanding the foundations of a neural network (Recurrent Neural Network), and building a comparison with an animal to represent a simplified function of the network.
(L03) AWS Lab reflections, a report based on the interaction, and understanding of more pre-built labs and code with the insights and applications of what I learned.

Module 4:
(A04) A presentation based around a concept of Deep Learning (Tensors), designed to be easily understandable for an 11 year old. 
(L04) A lab based around concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks, including a journal where I had to learn, and fill in blank portions of code, as well as a reflective journal with my insights.

Module 5:
(A05) A report/presentation on the movie "Arrival"(2016), and how the challenges they faced translating an alien language, relate to how NLP models need to understand language.
(L05) Part 2 of the AWS Lab Reflections

Module 6:
(L06) A lab that taught me about the use of tranformers/ BERT, reading the code and filling in missing portions, and making a journal on my experience.

Midterm Project:
(MD) A lab where I had to integrate a neural network into a diffusion model to create images, creating large portions of code on my own to make it functional.
Includes an assessment with questions I filled out about the model/my understanding.

Final/Capstone Project:
Creating a working AI Agent from scratch (W.I.P)
