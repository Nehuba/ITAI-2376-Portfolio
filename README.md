# ITAI-2376-Portfolio

This portfolio contains the coursework I did for my ITAI 2376 - Deep Learning Artificial Intellgence Class.
In this course I learned about the concepts of Deep Learning, Neural Networks, NLP, Transformers, Encoders, Machine Learning, and more. I also learned about the foundations of AI Agents, and got hands on experience with projects relating to the creation of various Machine Learning Models. These projects were usually complete in groups, and were focused on labs where we had to fill in parts of code, create architectures and concepts of a Neural Network, and building our own working agents.
